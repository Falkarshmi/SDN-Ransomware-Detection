# SDN-Ransomware-Detection
Applications to detect BadRabbit ransomware, using POX controller and OpenvSwitch.

This work was established to obtain a Masters degree in Cybersecurity from 
The University of York, with financial support provided by Najran University.

To run these codes, you must implement an SDN testbed which has POX utility as a controller, and OpenvSwitch as SDN data plane.
